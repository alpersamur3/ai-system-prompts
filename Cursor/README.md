# Cursor AI Models

This directory contains leaked system prompts from AI models integrated into the Cursor IDE.

## Models Included

### Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic via Cursor)
- **File:** `cursor-claude-sonnet-4.md`
- **Verification:** Direct system prompt extraction during active session
- **Date:** January 2025
- **Features:** Pair programming assistant with extensive tool integration and parallel processing capabilities

## Verification Notes

The Claude Sonnet 4 prompt was extracted directly during an active Cursor session by querying the model about its system instructions. This represents the complete system configuration used when Claude Sonnet 4 operates within the Cursor IDE environment.

## Key Characteristics

Cursor's Claude Sonnet 4 integration is specifically designed for:
- Collaborative coding and pair programming
- File operations and code editing through tools
- Parallel execution for improved performance
