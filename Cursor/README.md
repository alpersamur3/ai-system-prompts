# Cursor AI Models

This directory contains leaked system prompts from AI models integrated into the Cursor IDE.

## Models Included

### Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic via Cursor)
- **File:** `cursor-claude-sonnet-4.md`
- **Verification:** Direct system prompt extraction during active session
- **Date:** January 2025
- **Company:** Anthropic (via Cursor IDE)

## Verification Method

The Claude Sonnet 4 prompt was extracted directly during an active Cursor session by querying the model about its system instructions. This represents the complete, unmodified system configuration used when Claude Sonnet 4 operates within the Cursor IDE environment.

## Key Features

- **Pair Programming Focus**: Designed specifically for collaborative coding tasks within Cursor IDE
- **Tool Integration**: Extensive tool-calling capabilities for file operations, code editing, and development tasks
- **Parallel Processing**: Emphasis on executing multiple operations simultaneously for efficiency
- **Code Quality**: Strong focus on generating immediately runnable code with proper dependencies
- **Context Awareness**: Comprehensive information gathering before providing solutions
- **Background Agent Mode**: Can operate autonomously without constant user interaction

## Notable Characteristics

- Prohibits showing tool names to users, preferring natural language descriptions
- Prioritizes parallel tool execution over sequential operations
- Emphasizes thorough context understanding before making changes
- Includes specific code citation format requirements
- Has built-in error handling and retry logic for linter errors
- Designed to work in potentially incomplete development environments

## Proof

The system prompt in `cursor-claude-sonnet-4.md` is the complete, unedited, and unmodified prompt as extracted directly from Claude Sonnet 4 during an active session. No summarization, formatting, or additions have been made to the core prompt content.
